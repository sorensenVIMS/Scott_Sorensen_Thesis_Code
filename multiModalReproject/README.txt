This module contains code to generate the two mesh models for corresponding
thermal and stereo models. To test the module, run the testScript and it will
generate both the stereo and thermal model and write them to the meshes/ 
directory so they can be viewed in a program like meshlab, or rendered, or 
imported into virtual reality. Note: they are textured with individual images
that are not corresponding.
