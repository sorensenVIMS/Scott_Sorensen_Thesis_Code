This directory contains code for reconstructing objects in the presence of
a reflection, and the details of the project can be found in the paper at this link
http://www.bmva.org/bmvc/2015/papers/paper112/

To run this code simply execute the thermalReconstruct script. It will create a 
.ply file which admittedly isnt the prettiest but gets the idea across.
