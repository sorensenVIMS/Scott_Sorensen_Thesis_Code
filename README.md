This repository contains several directories containing code from various portions of my PhD Thesis. The code is referenced in the chapters and are meant to tackle problems related to computer vision applications for polar research. Each chapter will reference specific directories and each will contain a seperate readme file that will explain what each section is used for. Where feasible and applicable sample input data will be included.
